# 🛡️ Security Policy

If you discover a critical security vulnerability, please **do not** open an issue on GitHub.

Instead, [report the vulnerability privately](security) so I have an opportunity to fix the issue before it is publicly disclosed. Thanks :)

If you have general concerns, fell free to reach out at [johng.io/contact](https://johng.io/contact).
